 My Final Back-End project "Takzeen" using Java Spring Boot:
Connected to a database and deployed.

the idea of "Takzeen" is to provide the nearest place for the person to use it as storage unit which helps them to store it safely.
Also , allows people with free spaces to earn extra income from those unused space. 

There is two users (Admin,User)

1- Admin :
- He can add new place for the users to rent.
- Cn delete ,updat , and add to all the places he ownes.
-he can show all the places of his owen to check there status .

2- User :
- Display all near placess he can rent 
-Serach place accoriding to location 
- Search place according to location and type of storage 
- make an order by renting places
